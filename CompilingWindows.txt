Compiling on Windows
--------------------
* Install VisualStudio2012 (later version might work as well, but 32-bit vc12 mode allows to use precompiled versions of qt and opencv)
* Install Qt (version 5.4.2 including Opengl extension)
* Install Cmake (Executing it should be allowed by ctrl-clicking on it and selecting open, double-clicking will not work.)
* Opencv: Download and install in C:\opencv . It should have a build\x86\vc12\lib subdirectory
* Add the corresponding 'bin'-directory to the windows path (the lib directory is only for linking)
* HDF5: this is optional but allows to record into and read from HDF5 containers
  - Download and install. Copy installed files to C:\HDF5\1.8.15
* Add the 'bin' directory to the windows path
* Now open QtCreator (located in /users/tips/Qt) and click New Project - Import Project - Git Clone and for repository type:
  https://github.com/SamDehaeck/GigaViewer . Now select where you want to save and click continue.
* Take a look at the configuration options mentionned in the Gigaviewer.pro file, to select the options you want to include. For the different camera backends, you need to install their 'drivers' first (to be found on their websites).
