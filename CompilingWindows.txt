Compiling on Windows
--------------------
* Install VisualStudio2012 (later version might work as well, but 32-bit vc12 mode allows to use precompiled versions of qt and opencv)
* Install Qt (version 5.4.2 including Opengl extension)
* Install Git (Github desktop is an easy option)
* Opencv: Download and install in C:\opencv . It should have a build\x86\vc12\lib subdirectory
* Add the corresponding 'bin'-directory to the windows path (the lib directory is only for linking)
* HDF5: this is optional but allows to record into and read from HDF5 containers
  - Download and install. Copy installed files to C:\HDF5\1.8.15
  - Add the 'bin' directory to the windows path
* Now open QtCreator (located in /users/tips/Qt) and click New Project - Import Project - Git Clone and for repository type:
  https://github.com/SamDehaeck/GigaViewer . Now select where you want to save and click continue.
* Take a look at the configuration options mentionned in the Gigaviewer.pro file, to select the options you want to include. For the different camera backends, you need to install their 'drivers' first (to be found on their websites).

* If you want/need to recompile opencv or hdf5 you will also need to install cmake
* Open cmake and locate the source directory and define a build directory.
* Press configure and if no problems are detected, press generate
* Go into the build directory and build it (typing make or with visualstudio)
* Install it (by typing make install or with visualstudio)
