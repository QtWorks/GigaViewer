=> Play back by default in real-time.
=> Allow zooming by scrolling
=> Allow cropping with offset X and Y
=> When only a single image present, it is not shown: Not starting at beginning/ending with last image?

=> IDS camera: implement FRAME QUEUE!! + clock frequency lijkt toch belangrijk hier, cropping, ..

=> Could create a RAM-sink to store a maximum of images in the system RAM => Can I poll for available RAM-memory? (=> can be used to decide on queue size in current backends to minimize data loss which would render this option unimportant). When finished ask where to store. => could solve issues when using a laptop for storing data. => polling is platform dependent but could be implemented.
 -- or could have this as an option (amount of GB of RAM that can be used).
=> kind of 'extra' options which are hidden by default like for the recording location dialog?
=> Min and Max fps and min and max exposure times should be shown
=> Allow modifying gain.
=> Allow modifying binning and skipping of lines
=> allow recording with subsample options or perhaps some compression settings?

=> Play High speed camera images directly (Multi-page Tiff?) From IDT.

=> Make display options pane to allow dynamic rescaling (uint16=>to min-max), colour interpolation,
   fixed scale, HISTOGRAM (=> Show histogram of current image).


PLUGINS
*******

* Allow for image processing extensions (PLUGINS): accessible from right click menu. Check which dialogs to show
        - Ronald's tracking and beam steering => will also require output of txt file with positions
                >> could be achieved with different outputsink which embodies two different outputs: saving unmodified images with 			   some skipping (lower fps is ok) + high fps x,y pair saving to csv file.

        - Ellipse Detection => will also require output to csv file
        - Background substraction (Schlieren applications): Another checkbox to activate
        - Colour Processing
        - Microscopy Toolbox:
                - Calibration + Scale bar? => with variable frequency target display scale bar on screen (+ stamped on images)
                - Imprint timestamp?
        - Opencv GoodFeaturesToTrack + optical flow?
        - Perhaps stack multiple post-processing options (pipeline) => ellipseDetection+track vs GoodFeatures+track vs Background + optical flow

Interface for plugins:

function startProcess() -> bool : initialise the processing plugin (perhaps plan some fft's...)

function setSettings(sampleFrame,othersettings) -> bool : set the parameters (can change a lot)

function process(frame) -> frame : analyse the data and return result that will be displayed

function startRecording(filename) -> bool : could be used for emptying the vectors/lists where we will push the results

function endRecording() -> bool : could be used for saving the final csv file with all results

function endProcess() -> bool : deinitialise everything

+ dialog to input these settings
