* Skipping images that will be saved. Image acquisition with framerates below 1/2 seem not so stable => Plus not visually smooth => Easier to define 1fps and skip 9 to have 0.1 fps. Also will be used for Ronald where tracking is at maximum fps and storing only as a backup.
   => perhaps extra line under rec folder with skip and subsample options. Perhaps compression settings?

* Allow for image processing extensions (PLUGINS): accessible from right click menu. Check wich dialogs to show
        - Ronald's tracking and beam steering => will also require output of txt file with positions
                >> could be achieved with different outputsink which embodies two different outputs: saving unmodified images with 			   some skipping (lower fps is ok) + high fps x,y pair saving to csv file.

        - Ellipse Detection => will also require output to csv file
        - Background substraction (Schlieren applications): Another checkbox to activate
        - Colour Processing
        - Microscopy Toolbox:
                - Calibration + Scale bar? => with variable frequency target display scale bar on screen (+ stamped on images)
                - Imprint timestamp?
        - Opencv GoodFeaturesToTrack + optical flow?
        - Perhaps stack multiple post-processing options (pipeline) => ellipseDetection+track vs GoodFeatures+track vs Background + optical flow

Interface for plugins:

function startProcess(frame) -> bool : initialise the processing plugin (perhaps plan some fft's...)

function process(frame) -> frame : analyse the data and return result that will be displayed

function startRecording(filename) -> bool : could be used for emptying the vectors/lists where we will push the results

function endRecording() -> bool : could be used for saving the final csv file with all results

function endProcess() -> bool : deinitialise everything




=> Single Snapshot capability: If Gigaviewer will be used for microscope applications => Snapshot often handy (also for calibration)
=> Play back by default in real-time.
=> Show histogram of current image
=> Allow zooming by scrolling
=> When only a single image present, it is not shown: Not starting at beginning/ending with last image?
=> Reading bitmaplist named image1.tif,...image10.tif in the correct order => typically (d+).ext

=> Ronald's USB camera: make it work for windows + implement FRAME QUEUE!! + clock frequency lijkt toch belangrijk hier

=> Could create a RAM-sink to store a maximum of images in the system RAM => Can I poll for available RAM-memory? (=> can be used to decide on queue size in current backends to minimize data loss which would render this option unimportant). When finished ask where to store. => could solve issues when using a laptop for storing data. => polling is platform dependent but could be implemented.
 -- or could have this as an option (amount of GB of RAM that can be used).
=> kind of 'extra' options which are hidden by default like for the recording location dialog?
=> Min and Max fps and min and max exposure times should be shown
=> Allow modifying gain.
=> Allow modifying binning and skipping of lines
=> Allow cropping with offset X and Y


=> Play XVI movies directly (Xenics IR camera)
=> Play High speed camera images directly (Multi-page Tiff?)
