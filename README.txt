The goal of this program is to create an opengl viewer capable of working
with Prosilica/AVT cameras and modify their important settings such as
framerate and exposure levels. And allow saving the acquired images to disk.

For the moment it works on linux and compiles on windows.
However, it can lock up the webcam on windows and also the display does not seem right.
I think it is related to the fact of using it on a separate thread but I am not sure.
Should do more testing to find out why this is, but unfortunately I do not have a windows test box..
