The goal of this program is to create an opengl viewer capable of working
with Prosilica/AVT cameras and modify their important settings such as
framerate and exposure levels. And allow saving the acquired images to disk.

For the moment it works on linux and (sort of) works on windows.
The only live test on windows locked up the webcam, but not sure if this is
due to opencv's videocapture or the program..
