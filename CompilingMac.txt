Compiling on Mac:
-----------------
* Install XCode (mac store)
* Install Qt (latest version for clang 64-bit work fine)
* Install Cmake (Executing it should be allowed by ctrl-clicking on it and selecting open, double-clicking will not work.)
* Opencv
  - Download and unzip
  - Make build directory
  - With CMake locate the source code directory and the build directory: press configure and generate (defaults are fine)
  - go with terminal to build directory
  - type: make (or make -j 4 if you want it to go faster)
  - type: sudo make install
* HDF5: this is optional but allows to record into and read from HDF5 containers
  - Download and unzip
  - Make build directory
  - With CMake locate the source code directory and the build directory: press configure 
  - switch on the OsXFrameworks option (not sure if necessary)
  - now press generate in the cmake interface
  - go with terminal to build directory
  - type: make (or make -j 4 if you want it to go faster)
  - type: sudo make install
  - Stopping here should be ok but for me the compilation then worked but launching Gigaviewer failed due to some library mismatch problem 
    => remove some faulty(?) symbolic links by typing: sudo rm /usr/local/HDF_Group/HDF5/1.8.16/lib/libhdf5.10.1.0.dylib to remove this symbolic link. Also type similar things to remove libhdf5_hl.10.1.0.dylib, libhdf5_cpp.10.1.0.dylib and libhdf5_hl_cpp.10.1.0.dylib
* Now open QtCreator (located in /users/tips/Qt) and click New Project - Import Project - Git Clone and for repository type:
  https://github.com/SamDehaeck/GigaViewer . Now select where you want to save and click continue.
* In the configuration options mentionned in the Gigaviewer.pro file, you need to comment out the IDS, VIMBA and PVAPI options as no backends are available yet (Ids and Vimba do not support it yet and PVAPI could be possible but was not checked).
